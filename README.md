Are you just starting out on your PostgreSQL journey and looking to see how your skills stack up? Join instructor Sarah Conway in this course for a series of challenges that are designed to take you from an introductory level of knowledge to a more advanced skill set. Test your skills at solving challenges on how to query, select, add, remove, alter, analyze, view, and monitor records while interacting with tables, databases, views, and indexes. Sarah also includes some exercises that show you how to filter sensitive data, encrypt passwords, cancel running queries, generate fictitious data, and more. If you’re ready to take your PostgreSQL skills to the next level, get started here!


 
This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time—all while using a tool that you’ll likely encounter in the workplace.



Each installment of the Level Up series offers at least 15 bite-sized opportunities to practice programming at various levels of difficulty, so you can challenge yourself and reinforce what you’ve learned. Check out the “Using GitHub Codespaces with this course” video to learn how to get a codespace up and running.
